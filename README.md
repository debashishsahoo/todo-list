# Todo Mate

Todo Mate allows users to keep track of their upcoming tasks in a user-friendly manner, tick them off seamlessly when completed, and ensures that you never forget 

## Objective

Todo Mate is a fairly simple app built largely to mess with a bit of vanilla JavaScript, focus on the visual aspects, and create responsive layouts. 
The user's tasks are hence stored prematurely in their local browser's Local Storage.

## Features

- Add tasks and allocate a date and time to each task if you desire! (set to current date and time by default)

- Navigate seamlessly between tabs to see tasks for Today (by default) and Tomorrow, all Upcoming tasks, all your Completed tasks, along with a list of Overdue tasks that you assigned to yourself but forgot to complete on time!
